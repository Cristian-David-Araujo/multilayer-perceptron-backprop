# multilayer-perceptron-backprop
This repository features an implementation of a multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network trained using the backpropagation algorithm. The MLP is capable of solving complex, non-linear classification problems by utilizing multiple layers of neurons, making it a foundational tool in deep learning applications.
